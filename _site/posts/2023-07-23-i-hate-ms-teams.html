<h3 id="the-beginning">The beginning</h3>
<p>Some time in 2020 the pandemic has struck the world and left everyone stuck at their home.
The need arised for a software product to help people communicate.
This started the trend of using the infamous Microsoft Teams.
Every school, university and business adopted this product for communication.
This meant that everyone had to use it.
Soon it became the de-facto communication tool for everyone.</p>
